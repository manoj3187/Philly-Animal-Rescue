                <strong>What to do if you’ve found a pet</strong><br><br>
                Thank you for looking out for the pet you have found! Below is a list of recommended steps to assist you in locating the family of the lost pet.  
<br><br><b>Contact the Owner.</b> If the pet has any visible ID (tags, etc.) contact the owner. Look around the neighborhood and ask people if they have seen anyone searching for a missing pet. The first-place owners look for their pet is the community, so it’s important to spread the word as someone may recognize the pet and be able to help you reunite them!
<br><br>
<b>Research the Tags.</b> You may use these resources to track down an owner based on the ID tags:  
<ol> Dog License: Can be traced by emailing the ACCT Philly team at <a href="#">info@acctphilly.org</a></ol>
<ol>Rabies tags will have vet or shelter information on them – contact them with the tag number so they can contact the owner</ol>
<ol>If you have had the pet scanned for a microchip at a vet office, you can search the number on <a href="#">www.petmicrochiplookup.org</a> to locate the phone number of the company that the chip is registered with. We’re happy to help with microchip follow up as well.</ol>
<br><br>
<b>Keep the Lost Pet but File a Found Pet Report.</b> By filing a Found Pet report with Philly Animal Rescue, you must submit your contact information and email address so that one of our representatives may contact you if a match is made. Please keep in mind that you are required to hold the animal for the hold period which we can advise you on depending on if they have a microchip or not, and give them back to the owner if an owner comes forward during that time frame. Additionally, don’t jump to conclusions about a pet’s owner based on the pet’s condition. Sometimes pets may have injuries or look matted and uncared for after having been out for a while, and it isn’t necessarily reflective of the care they received.
<br><b>You may file a found pet report</b> <a href="./report.html">here</a>            
<br><br>
<b>Post to Social Media and Similar Sites.</b> Facebook is an incredible resource for owners and for our volunteers. Post photos, along with information on where it was found, what date, if it has any identifying markings, tags, collars, etc. *remember pets can travel a long distance in a short time. Don’t be skeptical of a person lost a pet far away from where it was found. Make sure to ask for proof of ownership (pictures or vet paperwork)
